## Sample Python Repository

### Setup instructions

1. `git clone` the repository.
2. Ensure poetry is installed. 
3. `cd sample-python`
4. `poetry shell`
5. `poetry install`
6. `pre-commit install`. This runs based on a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the repository. To run checks, use `pre-commit run -a`.
